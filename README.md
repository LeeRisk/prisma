# Prisma

It's a miniature version of the original Prisma app, more like a proof-of-concept. I am using real-time style transfer using [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155). For the same, I have adapted [this code](https://github.com/abhiskk/fast-neural-style) and used the pre-trained models as well to provide an API endpoint.  

### TODO

- [ ] Add support for multiple filters in server
- [ ] Add screenshots
