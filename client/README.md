# Deep Face App

This app is basically a image select-and-upload service which communicates with the backend which does the heavy computation work. Being decoupled with the functionality of style transfer, the client can be entirely reused with a different functionality running in the backend.

## Dependencies

1. [Litho](https://www.github.com/facebook/litho)
2. [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)


## Running the app

The app should be built successfully as long as you have the Android SDK 25. In case you have a higher version, you can edit `build.gradle` accordingly.
