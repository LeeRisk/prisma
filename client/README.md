# Deep Face App

This app is basically a image select-and-upload service which communicates with the backend which does the heavy computation work. Being decoupled with the functionality of style transfer, the client can be entirely reused with a different functionality running in the backend.

## Dependencies

1. Litho
2. Retrofit


## Running the app

The app should be built successfully as long as you have the Android SDK 25. In case you have a higher version, you can edit `build.gradle` accordingly.
